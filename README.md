MDB Mini-Project 4

This app displays the weather based on your location. The user is also able to search up the weather in another location. 
There is also a button where you can change the date to look at previous temperatures in the past. There is another feature
where if the user pressed the speak button, they will be able to hear the weather instead of having to read it.
